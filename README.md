# Jayesh-Portfolio

Hello Reader, 

In my journey as a Power BI practitioner, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects that harness the power of data visualization and analysis. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. In this github profile, I will showcase a few of my most impactful Power BI projects and outline the key learnings that I gained along the way. 

I invite recruiters and organizations to explore these projects and reach out to discuss how I can contribute to their data-driven initiatives.

ðŸ“Œ Learning from project:

1) Data cleaning is done in power query like use filters, add new columns with proper format of complex calculated data
2) Created connections between two table, joined new table and calculations done to manipulate data, used DAX formulas to create new columns and added new measure 
3) Created interactive dashboard in PowerBI and share to client 
4) Used different types of customisable visualisation like (bar charts, donut chart, pie chart, line chart, maps, slicers, cards, etc)
5) Used different shapes and colour codes to enhance visualisation
